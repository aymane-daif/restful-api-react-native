## Getting started

Open your MySQL Command Line and paste the following code [data.sql](./server/BankAccount/src/main/resources/data.sql)

## Next steps

1. To bootstrap the frontend

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

2. To bootstrap the backend

   **Use your prefered IDE and run ./server/BankAccount/src/main/java/ma/ensa/api/BankAccount/BankAccountApplication.java as an application**

3. <mark>Now you are good to go just be aware that in order to test the app you have to use a device emulator not a physical device due to expo policies. It allows only https connections over http</mark>.
